*variable
    Think of variables as containers for storing data.
    Rules for PHP variables:
        A variable starts with the $ sign, followed by the name of the variable
        A variable name must start with a letter or the underscore character
        A variable name cannot start with a number
        A variable name can only contain alpha-numeric characters and underscores (A-z, 0-9, and _ )
        Variable names are case-sensitive ($age and $AGE are two different variables)
    PHP is a Loosely Typed Language
        PHP automatically associates a data type to the variable, depending on its value.
    PHP Variables Scope
        PHP has three different variable scopes:
            local
            global
            static
        A variable declared outside a function has a GLOBAL SCOPE and can only be accessed outside a function
        A variable declared within a function has a LOCAL SCOPE and can only be accessed within that function:
